# Binding energy parameters 
## The page contains the binding energy parameters derived from the stellar evolution PARSEC code in collaboration with Mario Spera and Alessandro Bresan.

PARSEC (the  **PA**dova \&  **TR**ieste **S**tellar  **E**volution **C**ode is the code to compute stellar evolutionary tracks.
Information about the **PARSEC** code and its updates can be found in the following papers:
