# Binding energy parameters 
## The page contains the binding energy parameters derived from the stellar evolution PARSEC code in collaboration with Mario Spera and Alessandro Bresan.

PARSEC (the  **PA**dova \&  **TR**ieste **S**tellar  **E**volution **C**ode is the code to compute stellar evolutionary tracks.

The $\lambda$-parameter is a so-called envelope shape factor and determines the envelope energy reservoir for a specific binary star system.
A parameter $\lambda$ was introduced by de Kool in 1990 as a numerical factor to simplify the computationally expensive calculation of the binding energy of the stellar envelope: 

$$ E_{\text{bind}} =   - G \ \frac{M_{\text{d}} \ M_{\text{env}}}{ \lambda \ a_i \ r_L } $$

where $E_{\text{bind}}$ is total binding energy of the common envelope, $G$ is a gravitational constant,  
$M_{\mathrm{d}}$  is the mass of the donor star,   $M_{\mathrm{env}}$ is the mass of the stellar envelope, $a_{\text{i}} $ is the initial semi-major axis of binary system, and  $r_{\text{L}}$ is effective radius of the Roche lobe. 

We used the **PARSEC** code to calculate binding energy parameters for non-rotating hydrogen stars with metallicities $Z$=0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.014, 0.017, 0.02 and  48 values of initial masses in a logarithmic scale in the range between 2.0 $M_{\odot}$ and 600.0 $M_{\odot}$.

We also considered the possibility that helium stars can act as a donor in the process of CEE.
Helium stars are stars that have completely lost all hydrogen  through either stellar winds or mass transfer in binaries or did not have it at the beginning of the Main Sequence. We used the **PARSEC** code to simulate the evolution of non-rotating helium stars with varying metallicities $Z$=0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05 and of
and  for  78 log-spaced  values of initial masses in the range between 2.0 $M_{\odot}$ and 350.0 $M_{\odot}$. 
 
We calculated the binding energy parameter using different approximations. 
In the zero-level approximation, we  assume that the envelope contains only gravitational energy.
In this case, the formula for calculating the $\lambda_{\text{g}}$-parameter is: 

$$ E_{\text{bind}} =  {\displaystyle \int_{M_{\mathrm{core}}}^{M_{\text{d}}}  - G \ \frac{M(r)}{ r} \mathrm{d} m} = - G  \ \frac{M_{\text{d}} \ M_{\text{env}}}{ \lambda_{\text{g}} \ a_{\text{i}} \ r_L } $$



A better approximation of the $\lambda$-parameter with respect to the previous one is consideration of both the gravitational and the thermodynamic energy of the envelope.
The formula for calculating the $\lambda_{\text{b}}$-parameter is:

$$ E_{\text{bind}} = {\displaystyle \int_{M_{\mathrm{core}}}^{M_{\text{d}}} \left[ - \ G \  \frac{M(r)}{ r}  + U \right] \ \mathrm{d} m } = - G \ \frac{M_{\text{d}} \ M_{\text{env}}}{ \lambda_{\text{b}} \ a_{\text{i}} \ r_L } $$

where $U$ is thermodynamic energy of the envelope.

We also considered the contribution of enthalpy to the binding energy of the envelope. While enthalpy is not a real energy source, it plays a significant role in energy redistribution and causes quasi-steady outflows from envelopes. 
The formula for the $\lambda_{\text{h}}$-parameter is:

$$ E_{\text{bind}} = {\displaystyle \int_{M_{\mathrm{core}}}^{M_{\text{d}}} \left[ - \ G \ \frac{M(r)}{ r}  + U + \frac{P}{\rho} \right] \ \mathrm{d} m} = - G \ \frac{M_{\text{d}} \ M_{\text{env}}}{ \lambda_{\text{h}} \  a_i \ r_L } $$

where $P$ is the pressure  and $\rho$  is the density of the stellar layer.
